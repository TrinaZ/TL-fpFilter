# TL-fpFilter, a novel machine learning method that overcomes these limitations, filtering the false positive of target with unknown diluted sequencing signals by using the knowledge of false positive filter of source sequence data trained on fixed sample, by means of a transfer learning technique. 
The users may first use the ChangeName23.py to prepare the VAF file, and then to run the GenFeature.py to obtain the input matrix.
The TCA.m is the mainbody of the proposed Transfer Component Analysis, which is adapted by the TCAtest.m.
The third and the last step is to the Classify.py (Classifier20.py is only the newest version), and the validated output is created with the trustable evaluation.
